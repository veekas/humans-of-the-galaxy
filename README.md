# Star Wars API Example

## Features

- lists planets in Star Wars universe when app mounts
- planet names expand to show residents
  - shows loading message while waiting for API response
  - indicates lack of residents if response is empty
  - NOTE: I chose not to make the API requests until the click event to make initial load time faster
